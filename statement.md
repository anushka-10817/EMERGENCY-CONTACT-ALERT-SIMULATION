# PROBLEM STATEMENT
In emergency or stressful situations, people often struggle to quickly notify their family members or trusted contacts. Manually contacting every person can be slow or impossible during panic situations, health issues or unsafe situations. Therefore, a safe and simple Emergency Code Alert Simulator is needed so users can practice and understand different emergency alerts (like fire, medical, or security alerts) without any real danger. The simulator will help users learn how emergency codes work by showing alerts, sounds, and instructions in a controlled environment. This stimulation system can mimic emergency alert and help the users immediately.
